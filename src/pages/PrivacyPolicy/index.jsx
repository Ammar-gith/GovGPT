            <b>No Data Storage</b>
            <p>The AI system does not store any private, personally identifiable, or sensitive information shared by users during their interactions.

                Limited Session-Based Processing
                User queries are processed in real time and only retained temporarily for the duration of the session to generate responses. Once the session ends, all related data is immediately discarded.</p>

            <b>No Third-Party Data Sharing</b>
            <p>User data will not be shared, sold, or transferred to any third parties under any circumstances</p>.

            <b>Anonymized Data for Improvement</b>
            <p>Only non-identifiable, aggregated data may be used to improve system performance and accuracy. No data that could identify individuals or specific users will be collected or analyzed.</p>

            <b>Data Security</b>
            <p>Robust encryption protocols are employed to secure data during transmission. The system operates within a secure infrastructure to prevent unauthorized access.</p>

            <b>Compliance with Regulations</b>
            <p>The system complies with all relevant data protection and privacy regulations to ensure the highest standard of user confidentiality and trust.
                User Consent</p>

            <p>By using the system, users consent to the processing of their input data solely for the purpose of receiving accurate responses to their queries.</p>
            <p>This policy is subject to periodic review and updates to reflect technological advancements and regulatory changes. Users will be notified of significant changes to the privacy policy in a timely manner.</p>
